    ## SMS and MMS Marketing Notifications

    Ready to implement SMS and MMS marketing notifications? Here's how it works
    at a high level:

    1. A possible customer sends an SMS to a Twilio phone number you advertise
       either online, on printed propaganda or on TV advertising.
    2. Your application confirms that the user wants to receive SMS and MMS
       notifications from your application.
    3. An administrator or marketing campaign manager uses a web form to craft a
       message that will go out to all subscribers via SMS/MMS message.

    ## Building Blocks

    To get this done, you'll be working with the following tools:

    * [TwiML](//www.local.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml) and the [<Message>
    Verb](/docs/api/twiml/sms/message): We'll use TwiML to manage interactions
    initiated by the user via SMS.
    * [Messages Resource](/docs/api/rest/sending-sms): We will use the REST API
    to broadcast messages out to all subscribers.
    * [Sinatra Framework](//www.sinatrarb.com/): We'll use sinatra to structure
    the application.
    * [DataMapper](//datamapper.org/): We'll use DataMapper to define the model and
    to persist it.

    Let's get started! Click the right arrow to move on to the next step of the
    tutorial.

    ## Subscriber

    In order to send out marketing notifications to a subscriber, we need to
    provide the right model.

    * The `phone_number` will allow the application to know where to send the
    notifications.
    * `subscribed` let the application to identify which subscribers are
    active, only an active subscriber will receive notifications.

    ## Handling Incoming messages

    This is the endpoint that will be called every time our application receives
    a message.

    It checks if the command sent in the message is one of the commands that we
    are expecting. Depending on that it returns a message formatted in TwiML.

  data-file='app.rb'
  data-highlight='39-46, 67-78')
  :markdown
    ## Creating Subscribers

    If the command is valid, we look in our database for a `Subscriber` with that
    specific phone number. If it already exists we just update its subscription
    on the other case we create a new `Subscriber`.

    Depending if the `Subscriber` is subscribed or not, we return a TwiML message
    to the user.

    And that's all we want at this step! We've created a `Subscriber` model to
    keep track of the people that have requested our messages. We also have saved
    their information on the database after receiving a text message with an 'add'
    command.

.step(
  data-title='Manage Subscriptions',
  data-file='app.rb'
  data-highlight='39-49')
  :markdown
    ## Manage Subscriptions

      We want to provide the user with two SMS commands to manage their
      subscription status: `add` and `remove`.  These commands will
      toggle a boolean flag for their `Subscriber` record in the database and
      will determine whether or not they want to receive messages from our
      marketing campaign. We're not jerks, we don't opt them in automatically -
      rather, we have them confirm that they want to receive our messages.

      To make this happen, we will need to update the controller logic which
      handles the incoming text message to do a couple things:

      * If it is a `add` or `remove` command, create/update their
      subscription with the right status in the database.
      * If it is a command we don't recognize, send them a message explaining
      available commands.

    ## Sending Notifications

    On the server, we grab the message text and image URL, then loop through all
    Subscribers and call the method `send_message` to send the message.

    When the messages are on their way, we render back the index page with a
    success message.

    ## Send SMS or MMS Notifications

    In the method `send_message` we create a [Twilio REST API client](//github.com/twilio/twilio-ruby)
    that can be used to send SMS and MMS messages. The client requires your
    Twilio account credentials (an account SID and auth token), which can be
    found [in the account portal](/user/account).

    Next all we need to do is call `create` on the `client.account.messages`
    object in order to send our message. The Twilio Message API call requires
    a 'from', `to` and a `body` parameters, the 'media_url' is optional.

    ## Where to Next?

    That's it! We've just implemented a an opt-in process and an administrative
    interface to run an SMS and MMS marketing campaign. Now all you need is
    killer content to share with your users via text or MMS.
